## ðŸŽ‰ What We've Built

We have successfully created the complete database foundation for Big Appetite OS - a self-aware, learning business operating system.

- Complete evolution history tracking

### 3. Full Traceability
- Every decision links to reasoning logs
- Function calls track all algorithm executions
- Learning logs capture knowledge updates
- Audit trails track all changes

### 4. Non-Destructive
- Versioning instead of deletion
- Historical data preservation
- Rollback capabilities
- Evolution tracking

### 5. Boundary-Aware
- RLS enforces brand isolation
- Cross-brand data access prevented
- Complete audit trail for compliance
- Function-level access control

### 6. Self-Describing
- Metadata makes system interpretable
- Reasoning logs explain decisions
- Learning logs capture knowledge
- Contradiction logs track conflicts

### 7. Loop-Ready
- Outcomes feed back as signals
- Learning updates beliefs
- Contradictions trigger investigation
- System continuously improves
