## 💡 Segment Hypotheses

Based on the pattern analysis, the following customer segments are hypothesized:


Based on the pattern analysis, the following customer segments are hypothesized:

1. **Safety-Focused** - High Safety driver, low contradiction
2. **Status-Seekers** - High Status driver, medium contradiction  
3. **Growth-Oriented** - High Growth driver, low contradiction
4. **High-Contradiction** - Mixed drivers, high contradiction scores
5. **Quantum-Shifters** - Context-dependent behavior patterns

*Note: These hypotheses should be validated through clustering analysis.*

## 🧩 Clustering Recommendations

### Recommended Algorithms
1. **K-Means Clustering** (Primary)
   - Suggested k values: 5-8 clusters
   - Good for well-separated, spherical clusters
   - Works well with normalized driver data

2. **DBSCAN** (Secondary)
   - Density-based clustering
   - Good for identifying outliers and irregular shapes
   - Recommended eps: 0.3, min_samples: 10

3. **Hierarchical Clustering** (Validation)
   - Good for understanding cluster relationships
   - Useful for determining optimal number of clusters

### Feature Configuration
- **Include Drivers:** Yes (6 features)
- **Include Contradiction:** Yes (1 feature)
- **Include Quantum:** Yes (2 features)
- **Normalize:** Yes (recommended)

### Expected Outcomes
- **Target Clusters:** 5-10 distinct segments
- **Minimum Cluster Size:** 10-15 actors
- **Quality Threshold:** Silhouette score > 0.3
